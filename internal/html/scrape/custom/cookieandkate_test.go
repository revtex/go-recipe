		Description:   "This healthy vegetarian lasagna includes lots of fresh spinach, jarred artichokes and the simplest homemade tomato sauce. This lasagna tastes even better the next day! Recipe yields one 9-inch square lasagna, which is enough for 8 to 9 servings.",

		Ingredients:   []string{"1 can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes", "\u00bc cup roughly chopped fresh basil", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, pressed or minced", "\u00bd teaspoon salt", "\u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes", "2 cups (16 ounces) low fat cottage cheese", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 cup chopped red onion (about 1 smallish red onion)", "\u00bc teaspoon salt", "4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced", "1 cup jarred or defrosted frozen artichokes, drained, quartered if necessary", "12 ounces baby spinach, preferably organic", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "9 no-boil lasagna noodles", "2 cups (5 ounces) shredded fontina cheese or low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella", "Garnish: sprinkling of additional chopped fresh basil"},
		Instructions:  []string{"Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. To prepare the tomato sauce, first pour the tomatoes into a mesh sieve or fine colander and let them drain off excess juice for a minute. Transfer drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper flakes. Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later (you should have about 2 cups sauce).", "Rinse out the food processor and return it to the machine. Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl. No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put it back onto the machine because you\u2019ll need it later.", "Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and \u00bc teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.", "Add the artichoke to the skillet, then add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach. Continue cooking for about 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until the spinach has dramatically reduced in volume and very little moisture remains in the bottom of the pan.", "Transfer the spinach artichoke mixture to the bowl of the food processor and pulse until the contents are finely chopped (but not pur\u00e9ed!), about 12 to 15 times. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with remaining cottage cheese and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Now it\u2019s lasagna assembly time!", "Spread \u00bd cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch square baker. Layer three lasagna noodles on top, overlapping their edges as necessary. Spread half of the spinach mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with \u00bd cup tomato sauce, then sprinkle \u00bd cup shredded cheese on top.", "Top with three more noodles, followed by the remaining spinach mixture. Sprinkle \u00bd cup shredded cheese on top. (We\u2019re skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Top with three more noodles, then spread the remaining tomato sauce over the top so the noodles are evenly covered. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.", "Wrap the lasagna with a layer of parchment paper over the top (or cover tightly with aluminum foil, but don\u2019t let the foil touch the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18 minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180 degrees and continue cooking for about 12 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty brown. Remove from oven and let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before sprinkling with chopped basil and slicing."},
